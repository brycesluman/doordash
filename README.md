I used a lot of new (to me) technologies since I figured this was a good chance to try them out. 
I created a MVI architecture using:
Android Architecture ViewModels with Flow
Room Database for caching the response
Hilt Dependency Injection
Jetpack Navigation
Retrofit for network
Glide image loading
I tried to make the code testable. That being said, I haven't had the time to create many Unit Tests.
